The goal is to develop accurate and reliable forecasting models that can estimate the prices of the listings using the provided dataset. 
In the real world, accurate price forecasting for Airbnb listings can have significant implications for both hosts and guests. For hosts, it help them set competitive prices, optimize their revenue, and attract potential guests.
